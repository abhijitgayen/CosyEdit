# CosyEdit: Unlocking End-to-End Speech Editing Capability from Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech Models

## Highlight 🔥

**CosyEdit** is an End-to-End Speech Editing model built upon the powerful **CosyVoice** zero-shot text-to-speech model.

### Key Advantages
- **Comfortable Speech Editing ☕**: No external speech–text alignment tools, no complex editing algorithms—everything is handled by an end-to-end model, just one-step editing.
- **Native Multi-Span Editing ✂️**: Natively supports insertion, deletion, and substitution across multiple spans within a single utterance, all completed in one inference pass.
- **Low-Cost, High-Performance ⚡**: Unlocks strong speech editing capabilities from existing zero-shot TTS models, delivering competitive performance with small model size and minimal training cost.


## Install

### Clone and Install

- Clone the repo
    ``` sh
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/abhijitgayen/CosyEdit.git
    # If you failed to clone the submodule due to network failures, please run the following command until success
    cd CosyEdit
    git submodule update --init --recursive
    ```

- Install Conda: please see https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html
- Create Conda env (lightweight ONNX runtime inference support):

    ``` sh
    conda create -n cosyedit -y python=3.10
    conda activate cosyedit
    pip install -r requirements.txt -i https://mirrors.aliyun.com/pypi/simple/ --trusted-host=mirrors.aliyun.com

    # If you encounter sox compatibility issues
    # ubuntu
    sudo apt-get install sox libsox-dev
    # centos
    sudo yum install sox sox-devel
    ```

### Model Download

You can download the pretrained models by running the following code. The pretrained models will be saved in `pretrained_models` directory.

``` python
# modelscope SDK model download
from modelscope import snapshot_download
snapshot_download('CJY1018/CosyEdit', local_dir='pretrained_models/CosyEdit')

# for overseas users, huggingface SDK model download
from huggingface_hub import snapshot_download
snapshot_download('CJY/CosyEdit', local_dir='pretrained_models/CosyEdit')
```

### Basic Usage
Follow the code in `example.py` for detailed usage of CosyEdit.
```sh
python example.py
```

💡 CosyEdit is fully compatible with the CosyVoice codebase. This repository supports both speech editing with CosyEdit and speech synthesis using the original CosyVoice TTS models.
